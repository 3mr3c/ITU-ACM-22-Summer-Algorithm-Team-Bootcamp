        /* Answer is the max distance for one ant to reach the end of the plank
        * in the facing direction. But when two ants meet at some point,
        * they change their directions and continue moving again in constant time.
        * So what is the difference between changing the directions and
        * continuing without any interactions? After all, ants are the same.
        * Thus, let's assume they don't change direction.

        * Calculate the maximum time needed that an ant can achieve to an edge.
        * (n = plank's length)
