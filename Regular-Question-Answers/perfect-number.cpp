     * We can check all the numbers until given number x and if it divides x then we will add it to sum.
     * But this algorithm runs in O(n). And it is not enough for given constraints. Can we do better?
     *
     * The idea is checking dividers until the squareroot of given number.
     * Assume that p divides number x, then let q = x / p will also divide x.
     * One of them is greater one and other one is smaller.
     * That means if we go over of squareroot of x we will repeat ourselves.
     * Instead of traversing all the numbers until given number we can traverse until squareroot of x.
     * If we detect once an integer p divides x, then we know q = x / p divides also.
     * Then we add p and q to the sum. This algorithm runs in O(sqrt(n))
