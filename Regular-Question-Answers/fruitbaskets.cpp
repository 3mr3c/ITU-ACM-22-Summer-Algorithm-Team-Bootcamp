/*
* We'll collect at most two different types of fruits continuously in an array, starting with any desired index.
* Basically, it asks to find the longest length of the subarray containing at most two elements.
*
* Main focus is the second, last visited type of, fruit, if there is a new fruit we let the first fruit be the second fruit and
* the new fruit be the new one. Keep track of the maximum of all current picks.
*
* [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,2,2]
* if we take above example

* first pass through 1s
* firstFruit: -1 //not seen yet
* secondFruit: 1
* secFruitCount: maximum 3
*
* firstFruit: 1
* secondFruit: 0
* secFruitCount: maximum 2
*
* firstFruit: 0
* secondFruit: 1
* secFruitCount: maximum 5

* firstFruit: 1
* secondFruit: 0
* secFruitCount: maximum 2
* // here firstFruit and secondFruit exchanged positions but they were still either 1 or 0
* // thus current_pick was always increasing in this period, maximum 12
*
* firstFruit: 0
* secondFruit: 2
* current pick will be initialized to secFruitCount+1 // +1 because of the new one
* secFruitCount as before starts with 1
* secFruitCount: maximum 3
*
* max_pick is the greatest of all current_pick values.
* in our case, current_pick's {12, 5} max_pick 12.
